# CPBoy

CPBoy is a work in progress DMG GameBoy emulator for the fx-CP400. It based on the [Peanut-GB emulator by deltabeard](https://github.com/deltabeard/Peanut-GB).

Since the CAS has a rather slow processor, a high speed emulator core is mandatory to run emulation at an acceptable speed. Unfortunately, the accuracy of the emulation suffers a bit, which causes some games to be unplayable or have bugs. 


## Getting Started

The SDK used by the emulator and the CFW necessary to run it, is not public at the moment. Therefore it is currently not possible for you to use this emulator.

As soon as the SDK and custom firmware have reached a usable state, I will make them public and update this section with an installation tutorial.
